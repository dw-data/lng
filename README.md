Since the start of the war in Ukraine in February 2022, Europe is trying to replace Russian gas. Especially Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Slovakia and France are big gas consumers. European countries are now investing billions in LNG infrastructure to replace Russian gas with LNG. However, the EU set itself the goal of being climate neutral by 2050 and that means no LNG. Hydrogen-ready is supposed to be the salvation from this as the LNG infrastructure is meant to be used for hydrogen. However, there are no clear strategies yet and a lot is unclear in regards to the usage of LNG infrastructure for hydrogen. Therefore, these current investments look like an expensive dead end for taxpayers and the climate. This analysis looks at the current investments in LNG infrastructure, the potential of hydrogen and the climate burden. 

In the following, more information on the creation process of the story is shared: Which data sources were used, how the analysis was conducted and how the data was visualized.

# Analysis

### Conventional vs LNG gas production

To show the difference between the conventional gas supply with Russian gas and the supply with LNG gas, we created the illustration based on the Greenpeace report.
